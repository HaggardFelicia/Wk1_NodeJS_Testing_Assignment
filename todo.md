  - [ ] Your add function will take in 2 numbers and return the sum
  - [ ] Your subtract function will take in 2 parameters and return the difference
  - [ ] Your multiply function will take in 2 numbers and return the product
  - [ ] Your divide function will take in 2 parameters and return the quotient
- [ ] Also, write 2 additional tests using JavaScript's Math Object. The two tests will be square root and max.
  - [ ] Your sqrt function will take in a number and return the square root - (Use Math's sqrt function)
  - [ ] Your max function will take in 2 parameters and return the max. - (Use Math's max function)

## ***Deliverable:***
