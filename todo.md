- [x] You are going to write your own unit test using the Math module using Jest.
- [x] You are to write tests and code for your math module that will add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
  - [x] Your add function will take in 2 numbers and return the sum
  - [x] Your subtract function will take in 2 parameters and return the difference
  - [x] Your multiply function will take in 2 numbers and return the product
